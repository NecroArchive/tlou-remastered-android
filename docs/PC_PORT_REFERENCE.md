# The Last of Us Remastered — PC port

Runs the PS4 **The Last of Us Remastered** (CUSA00552, with its update 1.11) natively on Windows.
The game's own x86-64 code runs directly on the PC; a runtime supplies the PS4 system libraries,
and a Vulkan renderer (the shadPS4 video core) executes the PS4 GPU work.

> **No game files are in this repository.** You need your own copy of the game (the dumped
> CUSA00552 folder, and its update). This project is not affiliated with Sony Interactive
> Entertainment or Naughty Dog.

## Status

Work in progress, playable from the prologue on, with rough edges.

- **Frame rate:** on a laptop with a Core i7-8750H and a GTX 1050 Ti Mobile (4 GB), 60 FPS in light
  areas and about 40-44 FPS in the heaviest area tested, where the CPU side of the renderer is the
  limit (the draw recording thread at about 87%): lowering the resolution barely helps there.
- **Frame pacing:** frame times swing while the game runs below its limit, and a fixed 30 FPS limit
  (launcher, or the in-game menu) makes motion clearly more even.
- **Known issues:**
  - NPCs sometimes move in jumps. It comes and goes between runs of the same build; the cause is
    not settled. The bursts of long frames that seemed to go with it shrank with the faster guest
    condition variables, and a fixed 30 FPS limit had no jumps in the sessions tried.
  - A frame that compiles many new shaders can pause the game for a moment, mostly the first time
    an area is played. The game's own frame watchdog is patched from 2 s to 20 s for that
    (`TLOU_FIXES=none` leaves the game unpatched). If a load ever hangs, start with
    `GOW3_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT=0` (slower).
- **Not available for this game yet:** mouse camera (the mouse drives the right stick instead),
  the draw distance sliders and keyboard button prompts, which need the game's own camera code,
  settings block and prompt textures to be located.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit).
- A CPU from Intel's 4th-generation Core (Haswell) or newer, or any AMD Ryzen: the game needs
  AVX, F16C, BMI1, MOVBE and LZCNT.
- A graphics card or integrated GPU with Vulkan 1.3 and a current driver.
- About 6 GB of free RAM for the game.

## Playing

**From a release:** extract the zip, open `TLOU Launcher.exe`, choose the game folder under Folders
and press Play. Nothing else needs installing. After that, a shortcut with the game's icon appears
beside the launcher.

**From this repository** (needs Python 3.10 or newer):

1. Put the game folder `CUSA00552` next to this repository's folder, and the update next to it as
   `CUSA00552-patch` (or name another update folder with `TLOU_UPDATE=<folder>`). An update you
   only have as a PKG unpacks there with `python tools/install_update.py <update.pkg> <game folder>`.
2. Build the runtime (below), then start the game with `launcher/TLOU Launcher.exe`,
   `Start-TLOU.cmd`, or `python tools/probe_tlou.py --boot --seconds 0 [--game <game folder>]`.
3. Saves and settings stay in `analysis/tlou-user`; the log is `analysis/tlou/boot.log`. Each
   session also records your controller input (`analysis/tlou/pad-record-*.txt`, the newest 5),
   so a crash can be replayed on the same route; `TLOU_RECORD_PAD=0` turns that off.
4. With this repository on a hard disk, put the shader cache (`analysis/tlou-user/cache`, about
   250 MB in some 12,000 files) on an SSD: the game reads all of it in its first seconds, and
   from a hard disk that takes long enough for the game to build pipelines itself, pausing for
   seconds. With the game closed, move the folder, then link it back:
   `mklink /J analysis\tlou-user\cache <folder on the SSD>` (in `cmd`).

The launcher sets the display, frame limit and folders, in nine languages; its Debug menu switches
each optimization off, some of them while the game runs. The in-game menu (Insert, or R3+L2 on a
controller) holds the graphics, controls and frame rate settings.

**Without a DualShock 4:** the touchpad (backpack, crafting) is Tab / Backspace on the keyboard
or Back/View on an Xbox-style controller. Shaking the controller is G on the keyboard or the
Share/Capture button (`GOW3_KEY_MAP` / `GOW3_PAD_MAP` `shake=...` rebind it). The flashlight
never flickers out by default, so it needs no shake: Celogamez's GoldHEN cheat "Flashlight Does
Not Turn Off" (`TLOU_CHEATS=none` turns it off).

## Building

From an MSYS2 **CLANG64** shell:

```bash
pacman -S --needed git patch \
  mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-{toolchain,cmake,ninja,pkgconf,python} \
  mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-{vulkan-headers,vulkan-loader,vulkan-memory-allocator,glslang} \
  mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-{sdl3,fmt,boost,robin-map,xxhash,ffmpeg,zydis} \
  mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-{spirv-tools,spirv-headers,spirv-cross}
git submodule update --init --recursive
gow3_pc/build.sh                 # the runtime: gow3_pc/out/gow3-probe.exe
```

Clone with `core.autocrlf=false`: line-ending conversion breaks the FSR-Vulkan patches.

`gow3_pc/build.sh` also builds `launcher/TLOU Launcher.exe`. With a profile in
`gow3_pc/pgo/tlou.profdata` it builds with PGO and LTO (about 10% more FPS in the heaviest area
tested); the profile is not in the repository, and without it the build is plain. `GOW3_PGO=off`
gives quicker development builds. A new profile needs a clean build.

`tools/package_windows.sh` builds `dist/TLOU-Remastered-windows.zip`, the release: the runtime and
its DLLs, the launcher, the scripts and a Python of its own. `tools/package_check.py` refuses game
files and paths of the build machine.

The launcher reads its background and icon from the player's own copy of the game. A local icon goes
in `launcher/assets/icon.ico` (not in the repository).

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `gow3_pc/` | The runtime: C runtime (`src/`), GPU library (`gpu/`: shadPS4 video core and shims), preparation scripts (`scripts/`). Diagnostics settings: [gow3_pc/README.md](../gow3_pc/README.md). |
| `launcher/` | The launcher (`tlou_launcher.pyw`, Tkinter) and its starter (`tlou-launcher.c`). |
| `tools/package_windows.sh` | The Windows release zip. |
| `tools/probe_tlou.py` | Prepares the game's executable (with its update) and starts the runtime with this game's settings. |
| `tools/tlou_pad.py`, `tools/tlou_bench.py` | Scripted controller input, frame captures and analysis; a repeatable frame rate measurement on a test profile. |
| `tools/decode_dump.py`, other `tools/` | Image dump decoding and other diagnostics. |
| `tools/install_update.py` | Unpacks an update PKG next to the game folder (PkgTool, `tools/pkgtool`). |
